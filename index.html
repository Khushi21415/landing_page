                    <p>A roadmap is a strategic document that outlines a planned sequence of actions or milestones to achieve specific goals or objectives. It serves as a visual representation of a project, product, or organizational journey, highlighting key steps, timelines, and dependencies. Roadmaps are essential tools for guiding teams, stakeholders, and decision-makers in understanding the overall direction and priorities of a project. They provide clarity, alignment, and a sense of purpose, helping teams stay on track and make informed decisions as they work towards their intended destination. Whether in business, technology, or other fields, a well-constructed roadmap is a valuable tool for achieving success.</p>
